## What I Learned
Developing this app was a significant learning experience that included:

- Understanding Android's MediaStore API for accessing and querying device media.
- Implementing RecyclerView for efficient item display and management.
- Handling runtime permissions for accessing device storage and media files.
- Integrating SearchView to filter and search through song lists.
- Developing a media player service for background playback and notifications.
- Structuring an app using best practices for Android development, including layout, manifest configurations, and UI themes.

This project not only deepened my understanding of Android development but also enhanced my skills in handling user interactions and lifecycle management, making me more adept at building feature-rich applications.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.

1. Build and run the app on an Android device running Android 12 or above.
2. Grant the necessary permissions to enjoy seamless audio playback.

## Future Improvements
